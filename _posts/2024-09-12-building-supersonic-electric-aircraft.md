Just began building a supersonic electric aircraft company [Torque Aerospace](http://www.torqueaerospace.com/){:target="_blank"} .

Plan:-

1) Build a remote controlled ( drone size ) aircraft to break the current speed record of 500km/h set by Luke and Maximo Bell

2) Build a single seater aircraft to break the records set by spirit of innovation 623km/h

3) Build a citation CJ4 equivalent around 10 passengers

To fund 1) and 2) I have exited my crypto positions ðŸš€
