### What will happen to jurisdictions that try to ban crypto ?


Different types of bans:-

-Preventing banks from servicing crypto companies - exchanges and foundations of crypto companies often maintain fiat banking accounts for on/off ramping for fiat and salary payments to employees
-Imprisonment or fines for possession of crypto currencies - under consideration in India and China ,
-Outlawing mining  - states have begun monitoring unusual electricity consumption patterns (venezuela) and removing bribed consecessions to miners (china)
-Restricting access to crypto websites on network level - venezuela is restricting coinbase 
-BGP attacks / rerouting node level traffic - no current known state level attacks but is a possibility 

Depending on the type of ban. Different parts of the ecosystem will be affected differently.

The table below treats each policy in isolation whereas jurisdictions may use them in concert.

While bans maybe effective in the short term in the longer term positive regulation and interacting with crypto networks directly (upcoming post) will be the most positive sum strategy.

When bans are enacted completely private crypto assets like Zcash will gain more adoption and users will use public networks like Ethereum only through mixers and other privacy options.

Jurisdictions will have to shift the tax onus onto citizens for self declaration of assets. If regulators start requiring centralized exchanges to white list crypto assets and some chains become non fungible. The market will begin to price private fungible assets more favorably and they will enjoy increased adoption.

Jurisdictions like India that initially try to take an oppressive stance will continually flip-flop realizing the futility and inability to execute the ban. In this time the jurisdiction may loose out on crypto project formation and innovation. It may also serve as an advertisement for crypto and develop a demand for p2p crypto.

Competitive jurisdictions should not be afraid of competition by crypto networks. As crypto will be pervasive across all jurisdictions , the effective governments which people increasingly 'exit' too will enjoy higher voluntary declaration of taxes. As private crypto assets scale people will have the choice to declare their wealth and will only do so if the jurisdiction has a competitive offering (sovereign individual thesis).
