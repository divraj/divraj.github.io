India has leapfrogged directly into a stock market economy like the USA.

1) There is limited scope for manufacturing growth. Large english speaking population = more exposure to western social media = aspire to do blue collar knowledge work = higher manufacturing wage costs ( taken from molson hart [video](https://twitter.com/Molson_Hart/status/1839648904054464640){:target="_blank"} )


3) Inept government which has stifling bureaucracy at all levels an example is the labor laws outlined by this [paper](https://the1991project.com/writing/papers/why-indian-firms-dont-scale-labor-edition){:target="_blank"}

4) Terrible humid & hot weather discouraging high cognition innovation except in AC and limiting manufacturing efficiency

5) India's smartest talent continues to emigrate to USA , Europe etc

6) India's startup ecosystem is full of doordashes ( labor arbitrage ) no innovative product or hardware companies. Most valuable startups like byju's are scams , zomato and swiggy further fattening a growingly obese & diabetic population

7) Inequality continues to increase, buoyed by stock market returns. While luxury car sales like mercedes-benz are growing other cars remain flat in previous quarters.
  
   "The top 10% of the population has seen an increase in their share of national income, from 42.2% in 2011 to 48.0% in 2021.
The top 1% has also increased their share, from 18.1% in 2011 to 21.7% in 2021.
The bottom 50% has seen a decrease in their share, from 14.7% in 2011 to 13.0% in 2021.
The middle 40% has experienced the largest decrease, from 43.1% in 2011 to 39.0% in 2021."

8) Ubiquitous cheap data and smartphones while hailed as victory is actually acting as spiritual opium impeding progress in several areas when combined with addictive western social media , gaming and gambling. While there is an occasional case of exemplary young people achieving alot on platforms like replit using smartphone 90% population are wiling their time on facebook, instagram, tiktok equivalents and stupid games. The people are losing the attention war to devices in a bad way instead of upskilling or working in manufacturing as mentioned in 1).
