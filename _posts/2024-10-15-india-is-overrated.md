India has leapfrogged directly into a stock market economy like the USA. 

1) There is limited scope for manufacturing growth. Large english speaking population = more exposure to western social media = aspire to do blue collar knowledge work = higher manufacturing wage costs ( taken from molson hart video ) 

2) Inept government which has stifling bureaucracy at all levels an example is the labor laws outlined by this paper https://the1991project.com/writing/papers/why-indian-firms-dont-scale-labor-edition 

3) Terrible humid & hot weather discouraging high cognition innovation except in AC and limiting manufacturing efficiency

4) India's smartest talent continues to emigrate to USA , Europe etc

5) India's startup ecosystem is full of doordashes ( labor arbitrage ) no innovative product or hardware companies. Most valuable startups like byju's are scams , zomato and swiggy further fattening a growingly obese & diabetic population
