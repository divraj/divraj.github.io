Quoting anthropic , while it tries to stay neutral you can see that all inventions of significant importance are done in climates where part of the year is cool, nothing in warm humid climates . 

1. Computers and the Internet: Much of the early development happened in temperate climates like California's Silicon Valley (mild, Mediterranean climate) and the northeastern United States (varying seasonal climate).

2. Antibiotics: Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in London, which has a temperate maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters.

3. Nuclear power/weapons: The Manhattan Project took place across several locations, including Los Alamos, New Mexico (arid climate with hot summers and cold winters) and Chicago, Illinois (humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters).

4. Television: Early development occurred in various places, including New York (humid subtropical climate) and London.

5. Smartphones: Like computers, much development occurred in temperate climates like California and New England.

6. Genetic engineering: Key breakthroughs happened in various locations, including California and the UK.

7. Artificial intelligence: Major developments have occurred in diverse climates, from the temperate weather of the US East and West Coasts to the continental climate of Canada.

8. Space exploration technology: NASA's work spans multiple climate zones, from Houston's humid subtropical climate to Florida's tropical climate.

9. Renewable energy: Innovations have come from many climates, though some testing of solar technology occurs in sunnier regions.

10. Transistors and integrated circuits: Bell Labs in New Jersey (humid continental climate) was a key site for early transistor development.
