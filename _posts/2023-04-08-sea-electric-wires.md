Cargo airships and ships on set transatlantic routes could use undersea or floating cables for electricity to power their electric engines for part the jourey or if feasible the whole journey. They can clamp on/off like mid air refuelling planes / trains if a direct path across the oceans is not feasible and use batteries for the other segments.
