No emissions and lower noise will make urban stops and favorable regulation possible.

Advances in composites and 3d printing will make structures simpler and faster.

Opportunity to own the whole stack = significant value can be captured in producing custom batteries and electronics for your own aircraft.

Electric motors are simpler, cheaper and lighter than jet engines. This versatility will make maintenance cheaper. Additionally multiple motors with unique placements on the aircraft will become feasible.

As the suppliers for the electric supply chain will be different it offers better avenues to negotiate margins and partnerships.

Progress in autonomous navigation will make smaller aircraft more viable.

Possibility to integrate assisted launch strategies as pressure to use incumbent infrastructure is not present.
