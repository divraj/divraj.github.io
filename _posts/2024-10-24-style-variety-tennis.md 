An underrated reason Federer was a fan favorite was his aesthetically pleasing technique on all shots, another was his variety of shots and strategies. 
Federer's straight arm forehand and single handed backhand possesses the style that Djokovic and Sinner can't match. Sinner's bent arm forehand and backhand while currently effective looks very contorted and unnatural. Alcaraz similar to Federer has a straight arm forehand which is better stylistically and is also said to be more accurate in the long run. Both Federer and Alcaraz also have visible variety in their game coming to the net more often , employing drop shots and slices. While Sinner has improved his serve he is a more one dimensional player from the baseline whose success will likely be capped when Alcaraz becomes more consistent.
