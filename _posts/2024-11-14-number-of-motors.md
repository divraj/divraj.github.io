title: "Optimal number of motors for an Electric Supersonic Aircraft"

An electric supersonic aircraft needs to minimize drag while also maintaining redundancy in case of engine failures. Electric motors make it feasible to have multiple units as fixtures are simpler and size can be varied easily. In spite of this ease adding multiple motors does add complexity in terms of cooling and wiring to the motors while also increasing drag surface area. For a single to four seater aircraft two motors could be considered optimal but this will add the need for control surfaces ( airlerons , rudders and elevators) incase the motors are fixed in orientation. To simplify control mechanisms while maintaining a sleek surface area four motors most likely powering ducted fans could be optimal as vectoring will be possible to achieve vertical takeoff and landing. In addition to VTOL there will be good redundancy and thrust for all phases of flight.
