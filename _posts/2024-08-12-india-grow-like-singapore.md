india should learn from singapore & dubai both have humid terribly hot climates

while industry still remains around 20% of singapore's economy today and was higher in 60's and 70's much of singapore's spectacular growth came from services , tourism , shipping and IT

many of todays most successful indian companies are in low value services / IT and some say india has skipped industrialisation to it's peril

india should infact double down on higher value added services , tourism and software

ofcourse there is room for very high end value end manufacturing like biomedical , aerospace and precision engineering

manufacturing automation using robotics is another option as robot productivity and cognition is not affected by heat. china already dominates this process as it is transitioning due to higher labor costs and low fertility

india already has a cultural luxury tourism sector but they can supercharge this like UAE / middle east to more luxe tourism in pockets of india

india should create various SEZ's and charter cities similar in principle to dubai which transplanted a new business system to create DIFC 

modi should shift capital to leh or some hill station in summer , thinking indoor in AC will limit growth
