Recommendations for warm toxically humid countries like India to combat the weather and improve future growth.

1) Create [cooler](https://www.divraj.com/posts/cooler-charter-cities){:target="_blank"}  charter cities which will replace commercial centers and the capital. E.g. in India only choice is areas with higher elevations like Leh and other hill stations

2) Change working hours to take advantage of relative coolness in the early morning, work hours should be moved to 0300 to 1100 hrs. Citizens can follow a biphasic sleeping schedule of sleep from 2100 to 0200 and then 1300 to 1600 in strong AC. In these hours of 0300 to 1100 due to relative coolness and lack of toxic sunlight workforce can move around easily by walk or public transport. Efficiency for hand based workers and factory workers will also be improved

3) Use nuclear power / solar to use AC abundantly. Create large AC spaces like mega malls, office blocks, stadiums and even outdoor AC like done in Doha.
