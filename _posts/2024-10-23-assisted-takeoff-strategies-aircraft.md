title: "Assisted Takeoff Strategies for Supersonic Aircraft"
author: "Divraj Jain"
---
To offset the currently scarce battery density supersonic electric aircrafts could use assisted launch strategies to save upto 5 - 35% of battery capacity needed for takeoff and intial climb. Catapults are commonly used on aircraft carriers and are tried and tested , they could be installed in high volume airports owing to high infrastructure costs. Airship assisted launch if scaled well to could offer significant savings in the long run. 7-10% per takeoff is a massive saving. With companies like Airship Industries already building airships for cargo electric supersonic aircraft could be retrofitted to launch until high volume necessitates specially built airships.
